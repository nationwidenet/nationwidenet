  Payments are processed according to provider terms. Nation Wide Net service fees are separate and non-refundable once service is rendered.</p>

  <p><strong>Service Termination:</strong><br>
  Nation Wide Net may terminate or suspend services if you violate these terms or provider terms. In such cases, fees paid may not be refundable.</p>

  <p><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong><br>
  Nation Wide Net is not liable for direct, indirect, or incidental damages arising from use or inability to use services facilitated through our platform. Our liability is limited to service fees paid directly to us, excluding provider fees.</p>
